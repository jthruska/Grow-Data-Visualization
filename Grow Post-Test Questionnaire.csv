","It was hardest for me to find the personal data in-progress goals because I feel like it wasn't as intuitive to figure out where it was located. ","I think the similar areas (e.g. in-progress goals and my goals sort of thing) could be streamlined to be in one location or found in one area. It felt like some of the tasks were more difficult to complete because it wasn't quite intuitive to figure out where certain things were located. "

I know they are not really someone else's plants but it's fun to pretend that I'm doing something with friends","Checking daily progress. I think maybe if they were in the article/journal tab it would make sense since you usually chart your goals in a physical journal. I think the metaphor would be clearer that way (you know like how computers have desktops and trash bins because that's an easy way to explain to non-computer people the function of these things). Instead it's in the personal profile page which feels like in every other app, that's where you change your password or username, not where you check your progress pertaining to the main function of the app. I think the daily progress should be on the main menu, with the daily goals so you can also tell what you may want to make a daily goal based on your habits.","I think the way that goals are structure is kind of weird. Like for an app called ""Grow"" it uses a goals-based outlook, where your progress is based on wether you've met arbitrary goals and not achieving these goals means you've failed and achieving them means you never have to come back and work on them because they're already achieved. This is neither how habits are formed nor is it how plants grow. They are always needing nurturing. Maybe there is another way to do this. Have people achieve certain badges with that plant on it or something. I don't know. But the app, philosophically, should use more of a growth-based mindset that is less concerned with achievement and incentivizes progress more."
